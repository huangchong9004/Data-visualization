{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# HW3 Q4 [10 pts]\n","\n","\n","\n","## Important Notices\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n","    WARNING: Do <strong>NOT</strong> add any cells to this Jupyter Notebook, because that will crash the autograder. Additionally, Make sure to delete or comment out any code you add to this notebook for testing purposes prior to submitting the notebook to Gradescope. Failure to do so may crash the autograder. \n","</div>\n","\n","\n","All instructions, code comments, etc. in this notebook **are part of the assignment instructions**. That is, if there is instructions about completing a task in this notebook, that task is not optional.  \n","\n","\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n","    You <strong>must</strong> implement the following functions in this notebook to receive credit.\n","</div>\n","\n","`user()`\n","\n","`load_data()`\n","\n","`exclude_no_pickuplocations()`\n","\n","`exclude_no_tripdistance()`\n","\n","`include_fare_range()`\n","\n","`get_highest_tip()`\n","\n","`get_total_toll()`\n","\n","Each method will be auto-graded using different sets of parameters or data, to ensure that values are not hard-coded.  You may assume we will only use your code to work with data from NYC Taxi Trips during auto-grading. You do not need to write code for unreasonable scenarios.  \n","\n","Since the overall correctness of your code will require multiple function to work together correctly (i.e., all methods are interdepedent), implementing only a subset of the functions likely will lead to a low score.\n","\n","### Helper functions\n","\n","You should not use - and do not need - any helper functions; implement the required functions by completing the function skeletons below. All of the fuctions you implement should be self-contained; each function should carry all of the code it needs to execute on its expected input(s) within its body. \n","\n","### Kernel Selection\n","\n","Be sure that you select the PySpark kernel from the kernel options above, if it is not already selected. Do not use the Python3 kernel. The notebook should default to the PySpark kernel. \n","\n","### GCP and Gradescope\n","We have defined a sqlContext for you, in case you want to experiment with or explore using SparkSQL to accomplish the below tasks while working with the jupyter notebook on GCP. \n","\n","You should _not_ use the SQL context provided for your final submission to Gradescope. For submitting to Gradescope, you should use spark dataframes and dataframe operations _only_. \n","\n","While it is not strictly required that you investigate different approaches to solving this problem using both a sqlContext and dataframe operations, there are subtle differences in the way that seemingly identical actions (e.g., reading in a csv file) sometimes work depending upon which of these you elect to go with. They can be surprising and are worth being aware of. So feel free to explore in GCP, but note that you need only complete the functions below using dataframe operations. \n","\n","### SparkSession Objects and SparkContexts\n","Note that you have access to a SparkSession object in the notebook environment in virtue of using the PySpark kernel. It can be referenced using the variable name _spark_ , and does not need to be explicitly created or defined. This beavior can be leveraged to read in the initial dataset. \n","\n","You also have access to a SparkContext _sc_ which is used to provide you with a sqlContext to execute SparkSQL statements on GCP. \n","\n","You should not need to invoke _spark_ or the provided sqlContext in any of your functions but the load_data() function. Do not hardcode references to _spark_ , _sc_ , or _sqlContext_ into any of your functions except for the load_data() function. \n","\n","### Assumptions Regarding Function Inputs\n","This question assumes that you're carrying the results of your prior work foward at each stage of data preparation and analysis. Thus, the _input_ to each of the _filtering_ functions below should be the _output_ of the _prior_ function. The inputs to the two analytical functions should be the output of the last filtering function.
